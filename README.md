# Abstract

It is often the case that people set up passwords
that contain personal information. For example,
if one’s name is Aditya, and their birth year is
1975, they might set up their password as
Aditya1975. 

This creates a predictive pattern
with most people’s passwords. Often, we find
that if people get their passwords compromised,
they change it to a similarly weak password
based on personal information. 

There aren’t many easily accessible methods to 
generate passwords based on personal information. What
I have done is provided a simple tool that forms
permutations based on users’ personal
information. 

This adds another layer of password cracking capabilities. 
It exploits people’s vulnerabilities and laziness 
when it comes to protecting their information and
choosing their passwords. Afterall, the human
vulnerability is one that we must be most
conscious about securing. This slight addition to
the functionality of JohnTheRipper exposes how
people are essentially giving out their
"secure" data for free to any would-be hacker.
